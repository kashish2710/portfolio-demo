# portfolio-demo
This is my personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring interactive mini-projects like a Clock, Simon Says Game, and Calculator. The portfolio is beautifully designed and includes a downloadable version. Each mini-project is fully functional and demonstrates my front-end development skills.
